# ggplot2 demo
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r myplot}
#today we will use the mpg dataframe in base R

head(mpg)

myplot<- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) 
myplot + geom_point(alpha= 0.4) #sets transparency of points to see if they are stacked



```

```{r plot2}

plot2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class)) #added color into original aes argument in order to color the points
plot2 + geom_point()

```

# make a scatterplot of 'hwy' vs 'cty' with different size points representing each 'class' and different colors for each fuel type

```{r plot3}
plot3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=cty))
plot3 + geom_point(aes(size=class, color=fl))
  #get warning tho because putting size to a factor doesn't really make much sense
```

```{r plot4}

plot4 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) #if mapped color here, would be mapping based on a variable (aka column in your data frame)
plot4 + geom_point(alpha=0.4, color="blue") #outside of aes call, you are telling it what color to make
```
